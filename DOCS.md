## Interesting Pages

Below, we list some potentially interesting pages useful when exploring dejavu.

* [solver](@ref dejavu::solver): the dejavu solver, used to compute automorphisms of a graph 
* [static_graph](@ref dejavu::static_graph): the graph interface
* [refinement](@ref dejavu::ir::refinement): the color refinement algorithm
* [orbit](@ref dejavu::groups::orbit): can be used to compute orbits
* [hooks](@ref dejavu::hooks): hooks are used to interact with the computed symmetries
